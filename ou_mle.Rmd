This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
library(Sim.DiffProc)
```
OU:
$dX_t = k(\theta - X_t)dt + \sigma dW_t$

```{r}
set.seed(12345, kind="L'Ecuyer-CMRG")
k0 <- 1 #1
theta0 <- 0.1 #2 #was -0.01
sigma0 <- 0.2 #0.5
# I think this is simulated data
f <- expression( k0*(theta0 - x) )
g <- expression(sigma0)
sim <- snssde1d(drift=f, diffusion=g, x0=0.1, N=10^3, Dt=10^-3)
mydata <- sim$X
# This is the model
fx <- expression( theta[1]*(theta[2]-x) ) ## drift coefficient of model
gx <- expression( theta[3] ) ## diffusion coefficient of model

fitmod <- fitsde(data = mydata, drift = fx, diffusion = gx, start = list(theta1=1, theta2=0.1, theta3=0.2),pmle="euler")
plot(sim)
```
```{r}
fitmod
```
